# Dynamic Vehicle First Person

A custom first person vehicle camera script, with inertia effects, dynamic horizon lock,
depth of field effects and a lot of customizability.

Originally made within Manual Transmission as a fix for locked camera with synced wheel animations,
but it got too big.

## Game requirements

* Grand Theft Auto V
* ScriptHookV
